          <h2>What is Anime and why should you watch it?</h2>

          <p>
            Anime, short for animation, is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation 
            originating from the island nation of Japan. Anime is different from cartoons 
            because anime has its own distinct art style, so it is important to know that all 
            animes are considered as cartoons, but not all cartoons are considered as anime. 
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>

            is entirely up to you if you want to give anime a chance. With that being said these are
            the reasons why you should watch anime. Anime is the perfect form of media when you want
            to spice up the shows you watch, this is because anime has a vast catalogue of genres 
            you can pick from and each anime has their own unique art style and form of storytelling.
            Anime is unique from other form of medias because of the vast amount of art styles present
            it goes from simplistic and meant for children to dark with a bit of realism, its colors
            also vary from vibrant all the way to monochrome.  There are also countless different 
            shows airing everyday with options reaching from anime decades ago. Anime is accessible
            to any kind of person from any age group be it children or seniors there is an anime out
            there for you. Anime offers more complex stories with in-depth themes and character
            developments. When watching an anime, a story line can last multiple episodes whereas 
            its western counterparts work in an episodic way of storytelling.
